* I'm going to put you in teams of about three students for the first half
  of class.  Be prepared to move!
* Sorry for any confusion about submission and such.  I'm still working on
  mastering a new teaching platform and style and finding time to get everying
  in place.
    * Work that I see gets submitted via email: Journals, 
      Code (after autograder)
    * Due dates are in UTC!
* There were some concerns about the autograders.  We'll consider those
  during class time.
* This week's "transition hiccup": The RSpec files for HW1 did not seem to
  work under the Ruby and RSpec on Cloud 9.  I've forked the assignment
  files and the new version seems to be working okay.
* I misread my schedule for today, and did not have a chance to read all of
  your homeworks and reflections.  I'll work from what I read, and encourage
  you to also discuss/ask further.
