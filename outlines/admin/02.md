* Welcome to CSC 321!
* I'll be taking attendance for the first week or so, since I'm *really*
  bad at learning student names.
* I'm working on getting the other Web sites for the class set up.  I'll 
  let you know as soon as I do.
* Our book says to use Bitbucket, but I'm comfortable using Github, and
  you'll find that the instructions work more or less the same. You can
  use whichever you'd like.

### Upcoming Work

* For Friday: Finish Chapter 1 of Hartl (including all construction).
* 8pm Thursday: Reading Journal on Hartl, Chapter 1
    * Message subject: CSC 321 Journal 3 (Your Name)
    * What, in your own words, is the MVC framework?  Why do programmers
      use such a framework?
    * Which task was the most difficult for you to complete?  What instructions
      would have helped you get through that task faster?
    * If you wanted `https://yoursite.c9users.io/goodbye` to show the
      text "Thanks for Visiting", what steps would you do?
    * What is something you found particularly confusing or puzzling in
      the reading?
