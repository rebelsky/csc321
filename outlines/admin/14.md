### Upcoming Work

* Reading for Wednesday
    * SaaSbook, Chapter 7 (BDD), which is what I thought I previously assigned
* Journal for Wednesday, Due Tuesday at 10:00 p.m.
    * Find a Cucumber scenario for a Rails project.  You can look in 
      your project codebase, at the Cucumber Web sites, or wherever.
    * Describe the relationships between the various parts of the Cucumber
      tests (the overview, the setup, the particular examples, the parsing
      code, the code that does the work, and the Capybara support).
    * Suppose you didn't want to use Cucumber.  How might you best set up
      for BDD?
    * What's the most confusing part of BDD/Cucumber?  Explain it in 
      your own words.
