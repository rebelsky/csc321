* We are continuing to hit transition problems.  I'll do my best to
  help you work through them.
    * We'll work through the rest of HW2 in class today.
    * I have time reserved on Saturday to work through the new Chapter 7 
      examples (hopefully in advance of when you'll be doing them).
* We will be temporarily skipping over chapters 5 and 6 to move on to BDD.
    * Because we have a half class, we may not come back to chapter 6.
* No matter what it says online, your next homework is at
  <https://github.com/saasbook/hw-bdd-tdd-cycle>.  When cloning, clone
  `hw-bdd-tdd-cycle`, not `bdd-tdd-cycle.`
