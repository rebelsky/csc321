* Friday PSA!
* Warning: ALthough I teach the UML, I don't use it all that much.
  (I also don't work in medium or large software teams.)
* Note: When Dr. Davis designed this class, she did not include a significant
  component on the UML.  However, one of the class mentors noted that he had
  found serious value in using the UML, and advicated for its inclusion.  I
  look forward to hearing what you think about this unit.
