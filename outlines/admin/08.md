* Welcome back!  I hope you had a good break.
* Most of you seem to have done the reading journals for this week,
  but not necessarily the programming assignment.  We'll probably use
  the second half of class for you to make progress on the programming
  assignment.
* I don't seem to have the second half of the course up yet; I'm waiting
  for the folks at EdX to post it.  
    * Reading: Chapter 5.
    * Programming: <https://github.com/saasbook/hw-oracle-of-bacon>
    * Partners tonight.
