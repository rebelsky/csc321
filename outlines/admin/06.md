### Upcoming Work

* Reading Journal for Monday
    * You have now read three different introductions to Ruby (the Codecademy
      course, the SaaSbook, and Hartl).  What do you see as the major 
      differences between the approaches?  What approach do you find
      most compelling?
    * Now that you've seen a broader introduction to Ruby, what do you
      consider the most exciting aspects of working with Ruby?
    * What aspect of Ruby confused you the most? Try to explain it in 
      your own words.
* For Monday: Finish the chapter 3 project.  Send me a link to your GitHub
  repo.
* For Monday: Skim Hartl 4 and do any setup you consider necessary.
* For Wednesday: SaaSBook 2 and 4.
