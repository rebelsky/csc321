* We are continuing to hit transition problems.  I'll do my best to
  help you work through them.
    * We'll work through the rest of HW2 in class today.
    * I have time reserved on Saturday to work through the new Chapter 7 
      examples (hopefully in advance of when you'll be doing them).
* We will be temporarily skipping over chapters 5 and 6 to move on to BDD.
    * Because we have a half class, we may not come back to chapter 6.
* No matter what it says online, your homework is at
  <https://github.com/saasbook/hw-bdd-cucumber>.  (Agh!  I gave you the
  wrong one for this week.)
* You will also be doing some readings on computer ethics for next
  class.  Expect an email about that tonight (although I think I've 
  gotten it into the site for now).
