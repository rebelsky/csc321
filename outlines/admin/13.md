* I've heard from the SEPC that "CSC 321 feels like CSC 151 in that we're 
  learning things that we'll never use."  
     * I hope that you will learn a lot about software design in this course, 
       and even if you don't use Rails again, the experience of thinking 
       through the steps of building and installing sites will be useful.  
     * Note that the ability to roll out an interactive site in a few hours 
       is a great way to build a portfolio.
     * And CSC 151 is useful.  As a recent alum said "151 teaches you most
       of the things you should know about Javascript."
