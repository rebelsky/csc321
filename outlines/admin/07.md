* Friday PSA.
* I seem to be missing a lot of journals for today.  Please be careful
  to work on those.
    * Please don't write "Message subject" as part of the subject.
* I've over-planned for today.  Expect some of today to spill into
  Monday's class.

### Upcoming Work

* For Monday: Write three user stories related to alumni.grinnell.edu 
  or grinnellconnect.com.  You can write from the perspective of a
  student, a faculty member, an alum, an administrator, etc.  (And
  yes, your stories can be from different perspectives.)
    * Subject: CSC 321 2016F: Reading Journal for Day 8 (First Last)
