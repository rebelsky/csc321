* Guest lecturer: S.S.S.  Since I was already filling in for Rebelsky in
  CSC 301 and regularly serve as a professional algorithm consultant,
  Rebelsky thought I should also lead today's discusison.
* Rebelsky apologizes for missing class last week.  (He was out of it 
  enough that he slept from 9am to 5pm and then again from 9pm to 7am.)
* Rebelsky also apologizes for screwing up the Web site again and again
  and again.  He clearly needs to think more about professional 
  responsibilities.
* Your assignment for the coming week: 
    * The essay in the week 10 thing.  (The due dates are now updated.)
      (This is individual work.)
    * Read Chapter 9.
    * Legacy HW 1 is due the Tuesday after Turkey break.  You should start
      it this coming week.
    * Partners: SZ&AM, HD&EG, ZW&RJ, AH&DK, LG&NS, RG&TD, EB&DC,
      MO&ZC, BC&AO, EE&AD.
* Folks affected by Rebelsky's lack of updates
    * Slightly confused: BC, EE, EG, LG, RG, AH, AO, NS
    * Very confused: EB, DC, ZC, TD, AD, RJ, DK, AM, MO, ZW, SZ
