* I hope you had a good weekend.
* I spent Saturday at the second-year retreat and most of Sunday sick
  in bed, so I continue to be behind.
* Today will be one of those "Think about things and then report back"
  days.

### Upcoming Work

* For Wednesday: No additional reading.  Use the time to catch up in
  the two books!
* Reading Journal for Wednesday (due Tuesday at 10pm)
    * Subject: Reading Journal for Class 12 (Your Name)
    * Create what you think are appropriate models for alumni.grinnell.edu.
      (I'm okay if you describe them informally.)  Make sure that you
      indicate relationships.
