* Reading Journal for Monday (due Sunday at 11pm)
    * Subject: Reading Journal for Class 17 (Your Name)
    * From each of the three new articles about software engineering ethics, select one sentence that you think best captured its thesis. Quote that sentence, giving a page number and approximate location on the page (e.g., "top right").
    * What is one question arising from these articles that you'd like to discuss during class?
    * Brainstorm a few topics or questions that you might address in a 600-word essay on software engineering ethics (the last assignment). Your ideas might arise from the articles or from current events.
    * _As is often the case, these questions were inspired by the work of JLND._
