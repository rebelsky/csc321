* I'm going to put you in teams of about three students for the first half
  of class.  Be prepared to move!
* My "sanity plans" are failing in two ways: I'm not limiting my work as
  much as I should be and I'm also not getting everything updated as
  much as it should.  Expect to see the due dates get fixed on the
  Edge site in a day or so.
