* I was having trouble running Rails on C9 this morning.  Let's hope 
  that things are working better.  (My attempt to run Rails reasonably
  on MathLAN failed.)
* Attendance.
* Friday PSA.

### Upcoming Work

* For Monday: Finish Chapter 2 of Hartl (including all construction).
    * Send me an invitation to your c9 repository.
* For Monday: Reading Journal
    * Message subject: CSC 321 Journal for Day 4 (Your Name)
    * What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages of using
      scaffolding?
    * Pick three files created by the scaffold command (ones that Hartl
      doesn't describe) and do your best to describe them.
    * What is something you found particularly confusing or puzzling in
      the reading?
* For Wednesday (start early):
    * SaaSbbok: Chapter 1 and sections 10.1-10.2, 7.1, 7.3-7.4
