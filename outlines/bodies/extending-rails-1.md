A Few Ruby-isms
---------------

These are some reflections from your journals.

### Ruby != Rails

In answering questions, many of you seemed to conflate Ruby and Rails.
Ruby is a general-purpose programming language.  Rails is a Web application
development infrastructure that happens to use Ruby for its programming 
aspects.

### Duck Typing

### "Type-less" Programming

_How do you deal with the issue that you haven't clearly specified the
 type of a variable or parameter?_

### Mixins

### Everything is an object, even `Class` and `Object`.

_What does that really mean?_

### Metaprogramming

_What is it and why is it useful?_

### `yield`

### Symbols

### Blank Methods

    class StaticPagesController < ApplicationController
      def home
      end

      def help
      end

      def about
      end
    end
