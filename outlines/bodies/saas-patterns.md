Design Patterns
---------------

* Inspired by C. Alexander's work on Architecture, *A Pattern Language*.
* Leading OO-programmers/designers looked at common software architecture
  tasks/problems and came up with a taxonomy of common solutions to those
  problems.
* Valuable in (at least) two ways
    * For novice programmers, provides better approaches to
      tasks that they don't realize are old.
    * For experienced programmers, provides a language to talk about
      approaches.
* There are growing movements to write "patterns" (and "anti-patterns")
  for many different classes of problems.  There are even teaching
  patterns.

SOLID Principles
----------------

Intended as a mechanism for thinking about class design.  Five basic
principles.

* Single Responsibility - Do one thing well.
* Open/Closed - Open for extension, closed against modification.
* Liskov Substitution Priniplce - T's subclasses follow the interface
* Dependency Injection 
* Demeter -
