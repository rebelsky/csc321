Writing Prompt
--------------

Write a short essay reflecting on the ethics of engineering software as
a service, due November 24.

Parameters

* Address your question from the perspective of a software engineer or entrepreneur (not a user).
* Write approximately 400-800 words. Your essay should be tight: Don't waste words!
* Cite at least two of the assigned readings (from the two sets of readings) and at least three additional sources.
    * Your additional sources could be our textbook or a reading from another, relevant class.
    * Your additional sources could be a research article, magazine article, news article, or even a substantial blog post. The ACM magazines are all good sources, depending on your topic of interest.
* Use APA or ACM style for your citations.
* Use a 10-12 point font and double spacing (about 2-3 pages). Do not use a separate cover page.

Selected Articles

### Computing Ethics: Why Software Engineering Courses Should Include Ethics Coverage.

* "Ethical judgment, what philosophers often call practical wisdom, is needed most when moral dilemmas arise for which there are no easy solutions". Pg 25 column 1.

### The Ethics of Software Engineering Should Be An Ethics For The Client.

* "The developing nature of software engineering requires not a revision of an ailing code but a revolution in ethical thinking that acknowledges the purpose and practice of software engineering."   Page 39, bottom middle column.
* "The developing nature of software engineering requires not a revision of an ailing code but a revolution in ethical thinking that acknowledges the purpose and practice of software engineering." (bottom of middle column on first page)
* "We should consider software engineering as a communicative art where engagement with the client is at its heart and an understanding of the tasks, goals, and moral concerns of the client leads to the development of software that is appropriate to the client’s needs."

### Computer Experts:Guns-for-Hire or Professionals?

* "What is the state of the field of computing now and where should it go?"
* "Whether the field of computing evolves to come closer to the paradigm of a profession (or not), whether computer experts choose to see themselves as  guns-for-hire (or not), computer experts must act so as to be worthy of public trust." Page 26, middle column, last paragraph. (x2)

Issues to Discuss
-----------------

_What is one question arising from these articles that you'd like to discuss during class?_

Z: While reading the "Computer expert: Guns-for-Hire or
Professionals?" article, I constantly thought about the freelancers. Are
those group of computer scientist who work on a contract to contract
basis and sometimes chose the highest bidder by the definition stated
in the article categorized as "Guns for hire".?

Y: I am wondering to what extent having some sort of central power in
programming is necessary. If everyone has their own preferences and
practices when it comes to . . . well, almost everything in developing,
does that negatively effect our ability to communicate effectively
when it comes to ethical practices? To me, it seems that there are
many different practices out there, and that the different programming
ideologies are problematic for collectively forming standards. Perhaps
we can form “what should or should not be done,” but how heavily
is that question influenced by the background and preferences of
each programmer? Additionally, there is the even more forward looking
question. The guys who worked on some of the technology for the atom
bomb did not necessarily know that their efforts were contributing to
such a horrific use case—they were heading towards nuclear energy,
perhaps. Could the same be said for developing software practices,
and how does this change our perception of ethics in the software
community? (Especially open source).

X: Should the creators of the Les Paul Google doodle or other addicting
pieces of software be responsible for the time people wasted on their
creation? How much thought should go into creating a distraction
and where is the line drawn, (are video games un-ethical because of
‘wasted time?’) What is considered ‘wasted time’ and why is
it the programmer’s responsibility to keep track of it? Are things
created for the purpose of being distracting un-ethical?

W: Has there been any progress (either in discourse or in terms of actual
conclusions) in this debate? One article is from '08, another from '12,
and another from last year-- and they all seem to talk about the same
thing, namely the need for further discussion about ethics in computer
science. Six years is a really long time for the same debate to go on
about what is apparently the exact same talking point.

V: How is computer science different from other fields?  Why do we need
a specialized code of ethics?  There are a myriad of other industries
that have equally large reaches, can there not be a common code of ethics?

U: How should ethics be taught to computer scientists? What is necessary for ethical work in the field, and what is not ? Should the ethical standards of computing experts be higher than those which are not computing experts ?
 
T: If ethics is really important to understand, why don’t we learn
more about it at school?  Where in the Grinnell curriculum (or at least
the Grinnell CS curriculum) does consideration of ethics belong?

S: What do we think of a positive more holistic code of ethics?

R:  There's an argument that computer science is in need of a liberal arts education component for instilling humanity within computer scientists: for the majority of computer science undergrads that do not experience a liberal arts education, what is a solution for an institutionalized focus on humanities?
