### Admin

  But they have an updated version at <https://github.com/saasbook>.  
  Follow the instructions at <https://github.com/saasbook/hw-rails-intro>.
    * But the book is not yet updated.
* More good information on Rails is at <http://www.railstutorial.org/book>
* Today's class will all be working on Rails with a partner.
* Welcome to our guest mentors!
