### Questions

Work time
---------

*Hartl is all just copy-and-paste.  How are we supposed to learn anything?*

1. He does give you the occasional problem.  Do the problems.  They aren't
just copy-and-paste (although most are pretty easy).

2. You are in a 300-level class.  You should be going beyond the copy and
paste.  

* "What happens if I try *this*?"  
* "How do I accomplish *this*?"
* "What files were created?"  
* "How can I make the program crash, and what message do I get when it crashes?"
    * Fun things in Ruby often involve working with the custom.  What happens
      if you don't have an appropriately named file or method?
* Explore the difference between the wonderful C world of "any syntax
  error should prevent the program from running" with the even more
  wonderful Web world of "best faith effort to understand code, even
  if the code is complete garbage"
    * What if you remove semicolons from a css rule?
    * What if you have two css rules with the same name?

*Why did the screen saver go off in the middle of you typing?*

Computers are sentient and malicious.  More seriously, our screen saver
seems to consider mouse movement as the only relevant activity.

*How do I search for information on the parts of a Ruby application, such
as weirdo files?*

* I often search by the directory.
