Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* Welcome to CSC 321!
* I'll be taking attendance for the first week or so, since I'm *really*
  bad at learning student names.
* I'm working on getting the other Web sites for the class set up.  I'll 
  let you know as soon as I do.

Upcoming Work

* ASAP: Finish the Ruby Tutorial.
* 8pm Tuesday: Reading Journal on the Ruby Tutorial
    * Message subject: CSC 321 Journal Day 2 (Your Name)
    * What's something familiar you discovered about Ruby?
    * What's something new and exciting that you discovered about Ruby?
    * How does Ruby handle a programmer's need for multiple inheritance?
    * What is something you found particularly confusing or puzzling in
      the reading?
* For Wednesday: Make sure you've signed up for the fifteen or so services
  indicated in the email.
* For Wednesday: Skim Hartl, Chapter 1

### Questions

Quiz

What is this course?
--------------------

* A core part of Grinnell's software design curriculum.
* A good CS graduate can prove things and build things
* This course helps you learn some of the strategies for building things.
    * Particularly bigger pieces of software
* Bigger software requires
    * Multiple programmers and coordination among those programmers
    * Organizational techniques, particularly for how different parts
      interact.
    * Organizational techniques for the team.
    * Version control! (and versions of the program)
    * Different kinds of problem solving - In the large as well as in
      the small.
    * Clients and a way to better understand client goals.
    * Multiple files!  (And multiple types of files.)
    * Maintenance (maintain ants)
    * Perhaps some attention to efficiency
    * Testing, testing, and more testing.
    * Modularization
    * Formal commitments and penalties for failing to meet those commitments
      (aka "deadlines" or "death marches")
    * (May require) custom environment, including hardware and software
      stack
    * Scalability
    * Documentation 

Course goals
------------

What do you want out of this course?

* Learn how to structure software well so that you don't have the PITA 
  experience of the good reverend.
* Knowledge and skills for working on large pieces of software.
* Learn how to write software that can be scaled.
* Familiarize myself with common tools that programmers and SWEs use.
* Be a competent CS major.
* Learn how to work with people (peers, clients)
* Use different parts to provide a coherent whole.
* How to enter an existing project.  (More CSC 322 than 321, but ...)
* Good design practices for working larger groups.
* New languages and techniques and environments
* Agile development.

Why this course?
----------------

Why are you enrolled in this course?

* I made it through 207, and wanted to challenge myself more.
* I wanted to take a CS course, and this was a good time slot.
* Re'sume' building.
* I thought this was networks.
* Learn a broader view of programming.
* I wanted to learn more about Web development.
* Required for the major.
* I like to show up and bug Sam.
* CSC 322 sounded really cool, and I have to take this to take CSC 322.

Course structure and other info
-------------------------------

* In reflecting on the purposes of the software design sequence, the CS
  department decided
    * Real projects, that might take more than a semester.
    * Separate "skills/info" from the project.
    * Somehow intertwine the two.
* Discovery: Full semester doesn't work for 321 and 322 together.
* Starting this semester, new experiement: 321 is seven weeks, 322 is 
  14 weeks.
* It's a 300-level class, so assume 10-12 hours per week outside of class.
    * Coding! (4-6 hpw)
    * Reading and responding and watching (4-6 hpw)
* You will do some learning through watching videos (if you choose).

Model/Domain

* Ruby on Rails, with a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model
* Ruby is a popular and powerful scripting language
* Rails is a Web development framework that works with Ruby
* Mostly agile techniques

Books Etc.

* Fox and Patterson: Engineering Software as a Service.
    * Kindle, Print, MOOC, SPOC
    * Fox and Patterson are supposed to be rewriting the book *at this instant*
* Rails Tutorial
