The Subject Matter(s) of the Course
-----------------------------------

Big categories

* Primary Technologies: Ruby and Rails
* Additional Technologies
* Software Design 
* Agile Programming
* Software as a Service
* General Skills

Primary Technologies: Ruby and Rails

* Basic syntax of Ruby
* Iterators
* Convention over configuration 
    * If you don't understand convention, you make bad choices
* Routes in Rails
* Gems!  People have written things that you can use, and it's normal
  practice to add these things.
* Meta programming.  Code that develops code dynamically.
* How to use migrations and things like that.
* "Bundle install"
* Deploying to Heroku
* How to start a Rails app
    * How not to start a Rails app
* The parts of a Rails app
* Cucumber - A gem for BDD 
* RegEx - Patterns
* Rails tools like rake
* Rspec - For TDD

Additional Technologies/Practices

* Git / Version control
* Deprecation - Things change, sometimes faster than you want.
* Dependencies - One thing you want requires five things you don't know
  you want.
* Multiple environments - development, production, test, etc.
* Cloud 9 - Development on virtual machines
* Capybara - Web step definitions
* HAML

Software Design 

* A bit about design patterns
* Model/View/Controller
* UML
* Legacy code and how to deal with it
* Code smells - and what causes them
* Different models of testing
* Different metrics of code quality
* Architecture of large systems

Agile Programming

* Refactoring
* Behavior-Driven Development
* Test-Driven Design
* Iterative design 
* Agile approaches to legacy
* User stories
* Different roles, such as Scrum master
* Testing metrics
* Project velocity
* Pair programming

Software as a Service

* Definition
* Communication via APIs

Other CS Skills

* Pair programming in the cloud
* Duck typing as something in programming languages
* Different approaches to OOP than in Java
* A bit about databases
* The dynamic of dealing with ill-defined problems - should we Google, should
  we try to understand, do we understand correctly?
* Relying on existing resources.
* Ethics (we wield much power, we should use it appropriately)

General Skills

* Building the project builds the knowledge - you have to venture out into
  the real world
* Dealing with incomplete and ill-formed requirements ("The homework is
  somewhere on the Web site; figure out when it's due and how to submit it.")
* Working with others, even when you don't want to and when neither of you
  know what's going on
* Collaborating beyond your close partners
* Research methods (How to use Google and Stackoverflow better)
* "There's more to life than CS"
* How to deal with unexpected questions from an authority figure (more or less)
* Using MOOCs/SPOCs, particularly ones that are not quite up-to-date
* More self-directed learning
    * Choosing resources - Is video or text better?
* Thinking about deeper reading

Misc

* TLAs and TPLAs and Buzzwords (how to sound more impressive while
  confusing those around you)

Course Evaluation
-----------------

You know the drill.  I'll leave the room while you fill out the evaluation 
form.

Debriefing
----------

Things that will change

* Half-semester, full-time
    * Too fast; Worry that next semester will be even faster
* I will know more of the material
* I'll try to keep the Web site up to date
* I'll try to provide more feedback

Things that won't change (at least for the near future)

* Ruby/Rails
* The book/site
* Who is teaching the course

How did you feel about the following approaches?

* "Focused" small group/large group discussion in class.
    * It's hard to have a good big-group discussion
    * Small group is good; speed it up
    * This feels more factual; lecture might be useful; more "work
      through the example" would be good
    * Need more examples, perhaps examples to work through
    * Seems like a bit of a binary - If you understood it, the time wasn't
      useful; if you didn't understand it, the small group got stuck.
    * More time to work on the homework in class, with advice.
    * Success days: Early in the semester, first code smells, two ethics
      discussions
    * Applying the reading to a new problem would be a good model.
    * More info on what the goals of assignments was (logic or convention)
        * Taste of the approach
        * Start to learn convention
    * Disconnect between class and homework
    * For three fifty minute classes, about 1:1 or 1:2 talk/code
    * We covered a lot of material, but none of it deeply.  Should we
      focus it more tightly?
    * Planning is hard for a one-day-a-week course.
* Timeboxed homework assignments.
    * Good idea; relieved stress.  (Or at least necessary.)
    * Having available solutions would be good.
    * More feedback would be good.
    * Compendium of knowledge to get around the stupid things so that
      you can focus on the more important things.
* Mixed text/video.

Issues

* The book was not great in Kindle format; some parts that were hard
  to read.  
    * (Printed copies around the department would help.)
* Need more support / less work / more focused work / better scale of
  projects / improved schedule
* Find a better ruby tutorial
* There's not enough information to let you do the assignments.  The
  book did not prepare students well enough for the homework.
* Use a Rails book (or a Rails site) to learn things, use this book
  for the higher-level overview.  Gap between homework and book.
* Make it Grinnellian - have one of us write the readings and such (or at
  least supplemental readings and such).
* Focus on big-picture ideas rather than particular skills; skills we change
  and you will learn them on your job.

What are things that went well?

* 

What are things that you would change?

* More information on Ruby/Rails!
    * Plan one day per week on philosophy, one day a week on Ruby/Rails
      (or at least conventions and the work that Rails does for you and
      the rest of the world may not), one day per week for work time?

Final Comments
--------------

* This class was special.
* Take time to say goodbye.
