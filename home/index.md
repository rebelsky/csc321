Introduction
------------

Welcome to the Fall 2016 section of Grinnell College's CSC 321,
*Software Design: Principles and Practices*.  In CSC 321, we build
your skills in software development to prepare for you to do projects
in CSC 322 and elsewhere.  The current model of the course focuses on
Web applications with the Sofware as a Service (SaaS) model using Agile
Development principles.  We will ground many of the ideas in the Ruby
on Rails framework.

Catalog Description
-------------------

Provides a foundation for "programming in the large" and developing
high-quality software that meets human needs. Introduces the software
lifecycle, agile development methods, professional tools, and software
design principles. Includes hands-on laboratory work.

Class Format
------------

This course is being offered in a non-traditional format.  We will be
relying on a MOOC and SPOC as part of the core "textbooks" for the course.
We can then spend class time more on discussion and problem-solving based
on the readings and videos from the MOOC/SPOC.  (Some people would call
this a "flipped classroom.")

This is also a course in which you should be developing professional skills
and habits.  Hence, some of the work in the class will require you to do
exploration on your own.  The College would probably call this an opportunity
to "learn how to learn".  When you are stuck, I recommend that
you follow the strategy of [you must try, and then you must
ask](https://blogs.akamai.com/2013/10/you-must-try-and-then-you-must-ask.html).

We will meet three days per week for the first half of the semester.
You are expected to do about twelve hours of work outside of class each
week (and you may timebox that work).

Learning Goals
--------------

By the end of this course,  you should be able to

* apply agile software development methodology, tools, and practices 
  in real-world team projects;
* contrast agile software development methodology with plan-and-document 
  methodologies;
* build SaaS applications with the Ruby on Rails framework;
* consider ethical implications of software development; and
* apply techniques for understanding and modifying legacy code.

Important Warnings
------------------

*Warning!* The Berkeley CS 169 course that forms the underpinnings of
this course underwent some significant changes recently, and we
will hit some hicups because of those changes.

*Warning!* I continue to adapt to a subject that is not my primary
specialization.

*Warning!* I am unaccustomed to linking EdX and my course Web site.  At
times, you will find that the EdX site is not up to date.  When that
happens, please notify me ASAP.

*Warning!* Some students prefer readings.  Some prefer videos.  
You should try both for the SaaS stuff.

Basics
------

*Meets*: MWF 1:00-1:50 in Science 3819 (weeks 1-7 of the semester).

*Instructor*: 
[Samuel A. Rebelsky](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/)
[[rebelsky](mailto:rebelsky@grinnell.edu)],
Science 3824.  641-269-4410 (office).  641-990-2947 (cell).  
Office hours: TBD.  Book time at <https://rebelsky.youcanbook.me>.
I also tend to follow an open door policy: Feel free to stop by when my
door is open or to make an appointment for another time.  You can also
look at [my normal schedule](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/schedule.html)
for some information.

*Class Mentors*:
TBD
Office hours: TBD.

Grading
-------

*These policies are based on the previous version of the course and
may change.*

* __Class participation__: 10%.  Much of class time is in discussion.  
  I will evaluate you on the quality of your contributions.
* __Journal__: 30%.  Following the lead of Dr. Davis and Prof. Weinman, I
  ask you to do a journal assignment after each reading, video, and/or
  tutorial.  Journals are generally due at 8:00 p.m. on the night before
  class to give me time to reflect on them before class.
* __Homework__: 30%.  These are timeboxed.  If you spend the required
  time and document your efforts, you will get a minimum of 90% on
  a homework assignment.  Homework should be due about 5pm on Mondays.
* __Ethics Essay__: 30%.  Toward the end of the semester, I will ask you
  to write an essay about ethics.

Workload
--------

*I know that there have been concerns about the workload in this class.
I will do my best to keep the load reasonable.  Let me know when it's
more than twelve hours per week outside of class.  (If you don't want
to tell me, tell the SEPC and they'll tell me.)*

Here's what I expect you'll be spending your time on each week

* Class time (3 hours)
* Readings/videos (4 hours)
* Journaling (2 hours)
* Programming and writing assignments (4 hours)

The first week may be a bit busier as you get set up.

Communication
-------------

Dr. Davis created a Slack team for general discussion of CSC
321/2.  Join it here: <https://grinnell-sw.slack.com/>.  There is a
`#homework` channel for discussion of homework assignments!

Development
-----------

The course designers now recommend that we do development on Cloud 9.

it will primarily contain my notes for each class (outlines) and my record
of each class (eboards), but we'll see.

Fox, Armando and Patterson, David (2016). _Engineering Software as a
Service: An Agile Approach Using Cloud Computing_, latest edition.

> Our core textbook.  Fox and Patterson synthesized a lot of ideas
to produce a textbook that grounds software engineering principles in
a new model of computing.  This textbook is rapidly evolving.
I would recommend that you purchase the Kindle edition through Amazon,
particularly since they are updating the textbook again this semester.
(With the Kindle Cloud Reader, available at <https://read.amazon.com/>
or an appropriate app, you should be able to read the book on any
electronic device.)  If you purchase a hardcopy, you should not purchase 
a used copy, since they've made significant changes.
